# api-docs-generator-test-snapshots

This package contains vitest snapshots for various @minecraft/api-docs-generator scenarios, processing different configurations of Minecraft API metadata with different combinations of markup generator outputs.

It exists as a separate package in order to import both @minecraft/api-docs-generator and the @minecraft/markup-generators-plugin packages and test them together.
